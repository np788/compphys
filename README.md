## Computational Physics
This repo contains work done for Andrew MacFadyen's Computational Physics class at NYU during the spring of 2016. This was particularly challenging because it was a graduate level physics course and at the time, I had only take three undergraduate physics courses. It was a lot of work but I learned a lot!
