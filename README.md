# Computational Physics
This repo contains work done for Andrew MacFadyen's Computational Physics class at NYU during the spring of 2016. This was particularly challenging because it was a graduate level physics course and at the time, I had only take three undergraduate physics courses. It was a lot of work but I learned a lot!

## LIGO

## 2D Ising Model

This work used Python to model the spins of ferromagnetic atoms arranged in a lattice. At high temperature, these spins are all in random directions but as the temperature decreases, the magnetic interactions align the spins. Ernst Ising solved this model in his 1924 thesis for 1D. He believed that this model doesnâ€™t have a phase transition in any dimension. I demonstrated that he was wrong!
